In a nutshell, Magic Mind Brain Supplement is an energy-boosting drink that enhances one's focus and overall productivity. It is an excellent alternative for those who enjoy their coffee but do not want to get involved in its negative impact on the body.

James Beshara, the founder, could not give up caffeine. He needed an extra energy boost to stay alert during long working hours. However, drinking too much coffee only resulted in his frequent ER visits. 

Conducting extensive research on nutritional mushrooms and other relevant ingredients, he formulated a matcha drink that would help boost one's energy and performance without a trip to the hospital's emergency room.

Further, Magic Mind Brain Supplement is a matcha supplement that contains powerful nootropics, adaptogens, and vitamins. This new beverage assists consumers with a more steady energy and precise mental capacity.

Unlike coffee, this matcha drink has a magical combination of 12 active ingredients. So instead of sipping morning coffee that contributes to racing thoughts and rapid heart palpitations, Magic Mind Brain Supplement is just one magic shot that can help you feel awake and not jittery.

According to several studies, matcha drinks may improve one's brain function. In fact, some people drank matcha tea in a specific test, and the researchers discovered that it improved memory recall and attention.

It is also high in catechins — a plant chemical in tea that performs as an antioxidant that stabilizes potential adverse free radicals that can destroy brain cells and cause chronic conditions like brain fog.

*   **Turmeric**

According to medical experts, it is still undefined how Curcumin works. However, it can lessen brain inflammation, reducing the chances of severe depression and Alzheimer's syndrome. 

Like Matcha, turmeric has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that can aid in reducing brain inflammation while enhancing memory and mood. One investigation concluded that 28 percent of the participants had better recollections, while there were only a few cases of depression.

*   **Honey**

Honey can protect an individual's figure against neuroinflammation. Aside from that, it decreases oxidative stress while boosting brain-derived neurotrophic factors.

According to research, some benefits of honey supplementation include lessening weakened cognitive learning linked with age. Honey can also boost the consumer's memory and learning capacity.

Similar to the previously mentioned ingredients, Lion's Mane Mushrooms also prevent the spread of Alzheimer's disorder and control gradual memory failure.

*   **Phosphatidylserine (PS)**

Phosphatidylserine is another phospholipid that concerns the critical proteins' actions in cellular membranes. Further, studies show that PS increases brain function and treats brain damage.

In addition, PS boosts a person's neural membrane function while improving cognitive performance.

The Echinacea in a bottle of Magic Mind Brain Supplement has chemicals that reduce anxiety and help promote one's emotional well-being. For example, echinacea plants have caffeic acid, alkamides, and rosmarinic acid.

Vitamin D3 or Vit D in this magic drink can pass the BBB or Blood-brain barrier. Moreover, its receptors are throughout an individual's central nervous system. Vit D supplementation also raises cognitive performance, specifically memory, attention, and focus.

*   **Ashwagandha**

The frequent target of Ashwagandha herbs is to reduce stress and anxiety. They are an excellent adaptogen that activates the receptor for GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid). 

However, some medications with GABA can cause adverse effects like cognitive decline and tiredness. Fortunately, the presence of this herb can cause improved mental performance rather than impairment.

*   **Rosea Rhodiola**

Rosea Rhodiola is the last on the list of powerful ingredients in a bottle of Magic Mind Brain Supplement. Such a component promotes brain health improvement. In fact, several studies claimed that it increases an individual's learning capacities, attention, and short-term memory.

**Magic Mind Brain Supplement Side Effects**
